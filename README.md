üêç Snake Game with Neural Networks (Pygame + PyTorch)
This project is a fusion of classic Snake gameplay with the power of machine learning. Using PyTorch and reinforcement learning, a neural network is trained to play the game autonomously, learning from its own successes and failures over time.
